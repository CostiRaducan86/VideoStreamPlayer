/******************************************************************************
 * can_uart_bridge.h — Active CAN-UART forwarding bridge (Adapter_V2)
 *
 * On Adapter_V2 the diagnostic "CAN" bus between ECU and LSM is a UART signal
 * (2 Mbaud) carried as a differential PHY through CAN transceivers.  In the
 * fail-safe default (CAN_SEL = LOW) the adapter bridges ECU_CAN_H/L directly
 * to LSM_CAN_H/L, so AURIX sees nothing and there is NO monitoring.
 *
 * When CAN_SEL = HIGH the adapter routes the bus through two on-board CAN
 * transceivers wired to AURIX:
 *   U3  (ECU side)  -> CAN_RX_ECU / CAN_TX_ECU
 *   U10 (LSM side)  -> CAN_RX_LSM / CAN_TX_LSM
 *
 * AURIX then becomes an inline, transparent, bidirectional UART forwarder and
 * must keep the ECU<->LSM diagnostic link alive while tapping the traffic for
 * the PC UI (same role ASCLIN9 had on the previous adapter).
 *
 * Pin assignment (all on X103, verified against Infineon Application Kit
 * TC3X7 manual section 6 and the iLLD TC39xB LFBGA292 pin map):
 *   ECU side = ASCLIN5  RX P00.6 (X103 pin 24)   TX P00.7 (X103 pin 25)
 *   LSM side = ASCLIN4  RX P00.12 (X103 pin 30)  TX P00.9 (X103 pin 27)
 *   CAN_SEL  = P14.6 GPIO (X103 pin 5), driven via adapter_ctrl.
 *
 * Latency note: a transparent forwarder MUST have ~byte-level latency or the
 * request/response diagnostic protocol breaks.  Therefore forwarding is done
 * in the RX-FIFO interrupt (read source byte -> write peer TX byte), NOT via
 * large ping-pong DMA buffers (which would add milliseconds of latency).
 * DMA stays reserved for the high-bandwidth LVDS path (asclin1_dma.c).
 *
 * Monitoring: with two separate directional channels, ECU->LSM bytes are
 * requests and LSM->ECU bytes are responses, naturally delimited by per-
 * direction idle gaps.  Each completed directional frame is pushed through
 * can_diag_bridge_uart_frame() -> existing Ethernet 0x4344 path -> PC UI.
 *
 * ISR priorities: ECU RX = 11, LSM RX = 12 (unique vs GETH-TX 10, diag 13,
 * LVDS 14, camera 20).
