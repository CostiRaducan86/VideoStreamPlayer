/******************************************************************************
 * can_uart_bridge.c — Active CAN-UART forwarding bridge (Adapter_V2)
 *
 * See can_uart_bridge.h for the full architecture description.
 *
 * Summary:
 *   ECU side = ASCLIN5  RX P00.6  / TX P00.7   (X103 pins 24 / 25)
 *   LSM side = ASCLIN4  RX P00.12 / TX P00.9   (X103 pins 30 / 27)
 *
 *   ECU RX ISR (prio 11): drain RX FIFO -> write each byte to LSM TX FIFO
 *                         (forward request ECU->LSM) + capture for monitoring.
 *   LSM RX ISR (prio 12): drain RX FIFO -> write each byte to ECU TX FIFO
 *                         (forward response LSM->ECU) + capture for monitoring.
 *
 * Forwarding is byte-level (RX FIFO interrupt) to keep latency ~1 byte time,
 * which is mandatory for the request/response diagnostic protocol timing.
 *
 * Hardware: KIT_A2G_TC397_5V_TFT + SmartVisio Adapter_V2.
 *   3.3 V LVCMOS on P00.x matches the adapter transceiver VIO (3v3_LOCAL).

 * back onto the bus they came from (doing so fed the ECU its own request bytes
 * as garbage and tripped its fail-safe).
 *
 * Self-arbitrating mechanism (no fixed turnaround timer):
 *   REQ: forward ECU RX -> LSM TX.  LSM RX bytes are request echoes and are
 *        dropped until exactly as many have arrived as were forwarded
 *        (echoCount == fwdCount).  The first LSM RX byte beyond that is a
 *        genuine response  -> switch to RSP.
 *   RSP: forward LSM RX -> ECU TX.  ECU RX bytes are response echoes, dropped
 *        the same way.  The first genuine ECU RX byte beyond the echoes is the
 *        next request -> switch back to REQ.
 * The switch only fires once ALL of the previous direction's echoes are
